<PageTitle>Overview - LumexUI</PageTitle>

<DocsSection Title="Introduction">
    <p>
        LumexUI is an open-source project that offers a diverse collection of Blazor UI components,
        all fully built with Tailwind CSS for streamlined and modern web development.
    </p>
    <p>
        These components are designed to be not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly customizable,
        allowing you to tailor them to meet your specific needs.
        The library is optimized for performance,
        ensuring that your applications remain fast and responsive.
    </p>
    <p>
        We drew inspiration from
        <LumexLink Href="https://heroui.org/"
                   Color="@ThemeColor.None"
                   External="@true">
            HeroUI
        </LumexLink>, a React component library,
        in shaping the foundational ideas behind LumexUI.
        HeroUI’s approach to using Tailwind CSS, its elegant design,
        and robust customization system greatly influenced us.
        Our goal is to bring these same principles to the Blazor ecosystem,
        making them accessible to developers who prefer Blazor for their projects.
